      <h1>Disk Scheduling <img src="freepik__operating_system_color___rgb(17,45,78).png" alt="Operating System" style="height: 10%; width: 5%; margin-left: 50px;"></h1><br>
    <p>Disk scheduling is done by operating systems to schedule I/O
 requests arriving for disk. Disk scheduling is also known as I/O scheduling. It aims to:</p>
 <ul style="margin-left: 25px;">
    <li>Minimize <strong>seek time</strong> (time to move the disk arm to the required track)</li>
    <li>Improve <strong>throughput</strong></li>
    <li>Reduce <strong>response time</strong></li>
 </ul><br>
<h2><u>Points</u>:</h2><br>
<ul style="margin-left: 25px; line-height: 2;">
<li><strong><u>Seek Time</u></strong>&nbsp;:&nbsp; Seek time is the time taken to locate the disk arm to a specified track
 where the data is to be read or written.</li>
<li><strong><u>Rotational Latency</u></strong>&nbsp;:&nbsp; Rotational Latency is the time taken by the desired sector of
 disk to rotate into a position so that it can access the read/write heads.</li>
<li><strong><u>Transfer Time</u></strong>&nbsp;:&nbsp; Transfer time is the time to transfer the data. It depends on the
 rotating speed of the disk and number of bytes to be transferred.</li>
<li><strong><u>Disk Access Time</u></strong>&nbsp;:&nbsp; Seek Time + Rotational Latency + Transfer Time</li>
<li><strong><u>Disk Response Time</u></strong>&nbsp;:&nbsp;Response Time is the average of time spent by a request
 waiting to perform its I/O operation. Average Response time is the response time of
 all requests.</li>
</ul><br>
<h2>Disk Scheduling Algorithms </h2><br>
<ol style="margin-top: 20px; margin-left: 20px;">
    <li><strong style="font-size: 19px;"><u>FCFS</u></strong>&nbsp;:&nbsp; FCFS is the simplest of all the Disk Scheduling Algorithms. In FCFS, the requests are addressed in the order they arrive in the disk queue.</li><br><br>
    <li><strong style="font-size: 19px;"><u>SSTF</u></strong>&nbsp;:&nbsp; In SSTF (Shortest Seek Time First), requests having the shortest seek time
 are executed first. So, the seek time of every request is calculated in advance in a
 queue and then they are scheduled according to their calculated seek time. As a
 result, the request near the disk arm will get executed first.</li><br><br>
    <li><strong style="font-size: 19px;"><u>SCAN</u></strong>&nbsp;:&nbsp; In SCAN algorithm the disk arm moves into a particular direction and
 services the requests coming in its path and after reaching the end of the disk, it
 reverses its direction and again services the request arriving in its path. So, this
 algorithm works like an elevator and hence is also known as elevator algorithm.</li><br><br>
    <li><strong style="font-size: 19px;"><u>CSCAN</u></strong>&nbsp;:&nbsp; In SCAN algorithm, the disk arm again scans the path that has been
 scanned, after reversing its direction. So, it may be possible that too many requests
 are waiting at the other end or there may be zero or few requests pending at the
 scanned area.</li><br><br>
    <li><strong style="font-size: 19px;"><u>LOOK</u></strong>&nbsp;:&nbsp;:It is similar to the SCAN disk scheduling algorithm except for the difference
 that the disk arm in spite of going to the end of the disk goes only to the last request
 to be serviced in front of the head and then reverses its direction from there only.
 Thus it prevents the extra delay which occurred due to unnecessary traversal to the
 end of the disk.</li><br><br>
    <li><strong style="font-size: 19px;"><u>CLOOK</u></strong>&nbsp;:&nbsp;As LOOK is similar to SCAN algorithm, CLOOK is similar to CSCAN disk
 scheduling algorithm. In CLOOK, the disk arm in spite of going to the end goes only
 to the last request to be serviced in front of the head and then from there goes to the
 other endâ€™s last request. Thus, it also prevents the extra delay which occurred due to
 unnecessary traversal to the end of the disk.</li>
